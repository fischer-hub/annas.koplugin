# [KOReader Annas Plugin](https://github.com/fischer-hub/annas.koplugin)


**Disclaimer:** This plugin is for educational purposes only. Please respect copyright laws and use this plugin responsibly.

This KOReader plugin lets you search and download documents from Anna's Archive. Since it scrapes the HTML of Anna's Archive and tries to grab source links there is no need to log in with any account. However, as soon as there is changes to the Anna's Archive HTML code the scraper can (but it might not!) fail.

Big thanks and credits to the devs of the [KOReader Zlibrary plugin](https://github.com/ZlibraryKO/zlibrary.koplugin) which inspired a huge amount of the frontend code and UI for my plugin and to the devs of [KindleFetch](https://github.com/justrals/KindleFetch) which inspired much of my webscraping 'backend' code. Without these projects the plugin would probably not run at all yet lol.

The plugin was tested on KOReader installed on a Kindle Paperwhite 11th generation.
